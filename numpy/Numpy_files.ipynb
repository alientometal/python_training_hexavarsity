    "# NumPy Files\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy provides several functions to read/write arrays to/from files. This is useful when you have large arrays that you want to persist on disk for later use. Here's an overview of some of the key functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an array\n",
    "arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "print(arr)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## np.save()\n",
    "\n",
    "The `np.save()` function saves an array to a binary file in NumPy `.npy` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Save the array to a file\n",
    "np.save('my_array.npy', arr)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## np.load()\n",
    "\n",
    "The `np.load()` function loads an array from a `.npy` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load the array from a file\n",
    "loaded_arr = np.load('my_array.npy')\n",
    "print(loaded_arr)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## np.savetxt()\n",
    "\n",
    "The `np.savetxt()` function writes an array to a text file. You can specify the formatting for numbers and choose the delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Write the array to a text file, with numbers formatted as integers\n",
    "np.savetxt('my_array.txt', arr, fmt='%d', delimiter=',')\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## np.loadtxt()\n",
    "\n",
    "The `np.loadtxt()` function loads data from a text file. You need to specify the delimiter if it's not whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load the array from a text file\n",
    "loaded_arr = np.loadtxt('my_array.txt', delimiter=',')\n",
    "print(loaded_arr)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## np.savez()\n",
    "\n",
    "The `np.savez()` function saves several arrays into a single file in uncompressed `.npz` format. If your arrays are large and you want to save disk space, use `np.savez_compressed()` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Save multiple arrays to a file\n",
    "arr2 = np.array([[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])\n",
    "np.savez('my_arrays.npz', arr1=arr, arr2=arr2)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To load the data, use `np.load()` and access the arrays via the returned object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load the arrays from a file\n",
    "loaded = np.load('my_arrays.npz')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the individual arrays\n",
    "print(loaded['arr1'])\n",
    "print(loaded['arr2'])\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few of the file I/O functions provided by NumPy. There are more specialized functions for handling different types of data, such as `np.genfromtxt()` for complex datasets and `np.recfromcsv()` for data with structured dtypes. Refer to the [NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.io.html) for more details."
