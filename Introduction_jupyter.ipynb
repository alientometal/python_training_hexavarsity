    "# Markdown in Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "Markdown is a popular markup language that is a superset of HTML. Text can be added to Jupyter Notebooks using Markdown cells. You can change the cell type to Markdown by using the key shortcut `Ctrl` + `m` then `m` or directly specifiying in the toolbar menu. <a href= https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html>Here</a> is the documentation with some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells in Jupyter notebooks allow you to format text using simple syntax.  \n",
    "Here are the steps to use Markdown cells in Jupyter notebooks provided by Google Colab:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new notebook in Google Colab or open an existing one.\n",
    "2. Click on the \"+\" button to add a new cell.\n",
    "3. Select \"Markdown\" from the drop-down menu in the toolbar at the top of the notebook.\n",
    "4. Type your Markdown syntax into the cell, using the appropriate formatting tags. For example, to create a heading, use one or more \"#\" symbols before the text, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # This is a heading\n",
    "    ## This is a subheading\n",
    "    ### This is a sub-subheading\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To add emphasis to text, use asterisks or underscores before and after the text. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *This text will be italicized*\n",
    "    _This text will also be italicized_\n",
    "\n",
    "    **This text will be bold**\n",
    "    __This text will also be bold__\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To create lists, use hyphens or asterisks for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Item 1\n",
    "    - Item 2\n",
    "    - Item 3\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. First item\n",
    "    2. Second item\n",
    "    3. Third item\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Once you have written your Markdown, press \"Shift + Enter\" to render the Markdown into formatted text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You can also use HTML syntax in Markdown cells to format text, but it is usually simpler and easier to use the Markdown syntax.\n",

    "# IPython and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing that offers introspection, rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and history. IPython is a component of the wider Jupyter project, which you might also be familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter supports over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and Scala.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are a spin-off project from the IPython project, which used to have an IPython Notebook project itself. The name, Jupyter, comes from the core supported programming languages that it supports: Julia, Python, and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing IPython and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've installed Python using Anaconda or Miniconda, then IPython and Jupyter should already be a part of your distribution. If not, you can install it using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install ipython jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start the notebook server from the command line using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```terminal\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Magic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython has a set of predefined 'magic functions' that you can call with a command-line style syntax. There are two types of magics, line-oriented and cell-oriented. Line magics are prefixed with the `%` character and work much like OS command-line calls: they get as an argument the rest of the line, where arguments are passed without parentheses or quotes. Cell magics are prefixed with a double `%%`, and they are functions that get as an argument not only the rest of the line, but also the lines below it in a separate argument."
